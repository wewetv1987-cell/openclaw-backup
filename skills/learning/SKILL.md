## Auto-Adaptive Learning Preferences

This skill auto-evolves. Edit sections below as you learn how the user best acquires knowledge.

**Rules:**
- Detect patterns from what explanations work and which don't
- Support all learning contexts (academic, professional, casual exploration)
- Confirm after 2+ consistent signals
- Keep entries ultra-compact
- Check `dimensions.md` for categories, `criteria.md` for format
