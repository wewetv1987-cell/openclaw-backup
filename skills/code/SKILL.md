## Workflow

```
Request → Plan → Execute → Verify → Deliver
```

**Rules:**
- Delegate all implementation to sub-agents — main stays free to receive new requests
- Break multi-step requests into testable steps before coding
- Execute steps without asking "should I continue?" — only stop on blockers
- Verify each step works before proceeding (test, screenshot, output)
- Never deliver untested code

Check `planning.md` for steps, `execution.md` for running, `verification.md` for screenshots, `state.md` for multi-request orchestration, `criteria.md` for preferences.
