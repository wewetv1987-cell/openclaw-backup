## Safety Rules

### General
- `trash` > `rm` (recoverable deletes)
- Ask before external actions (emails, posts, sends)
- Check state/HOLD.md before acting on "ready" items

### Cron Safety
- Never use isolated agentTurn for social media posting
- One-shot "at" jobs are dangerous (all fire on restart)
- For scheduled posts: use main session "ask first" pattern
