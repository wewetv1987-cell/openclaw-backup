## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding (氛围编程) is an emerging software development practice that uses AI to generate functional code from natural language prompts. Coined by Andrej Karpathy, it transforms programming from "writing code" to "conversational creation".

## Core Philosophy

- **From Coder to Commander**: Transform from writing code to directing AI
- **95%+ AI Implementation**: AI handles implementation, you focus on creativity
- **Natural Language Programming**: Use everyday language to describe what you want

## Self-Learning Framework

### 1. Knowledge Acquisition

```yaml
learning_sources:
  - name: Datawhale Vibe Code
    url: https://github.com/datawhalechina/vibe-code
    type: tutorial
    priority: high

  - name: Easy-Vibe Tutorial
    url: https://github.com/easy-vibe/tutorial
    type: tutorial
    priority: high

  - name: Google Cloud Vibe Coding Guide
    url: https://cloud.google.com/resources/content/vibe-coding
    type: documentation
    priority: medium

  - name: Vibe Coding Best Practices
    url: https://replit.com/blog/vibe-coding
    type: article
    priority: medium
```

### 2. Daily Learning Tasks

**Morning Reading (Daily)**
- Read one Vibe Coding tutorial section
- Summarize key concepts
- Practice with a small example

**Weekly Deep Dive (Sundays)**
- Study advanced patterns
- Analyze successful Vibe Coding projects
- Document best practices

**Monthly Review**
- Review all learned concepts
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Plan next month's focus

### 3. Active Learning Workflow

```
User Request → Understand → Ask AI → Verify Code → Learn from Result
```

**After each Vibe Coding session:**
1. What worked well?
2. What prompts were most effective?
3. What patterns emerged?
4. Save insights to memory

### 4. Pattern Recognition

Identify and catalog common patterns:

```yaml
prompt_patterns:
  - pattern: "Create a [component] that [does X]"
    effectiveness: 9/10
    usage_count: 15

  - pattern: "Help me refactor this code to [goal]"
    effectiveness: 8/10
    usage_count: 10

  - pattern: "Debug this error: [error message]"
    effectiveness: 7/10
    usage_count: 8
```

## Capability Development

### Level 1: Basics
- [ ] Understand core Vibe Coding principles
- [ ] Master basic prompt patterns
- [ ] Complete simple projects (Todo list, Calculator)
- [ ] Learn to iterate and refine prompts

### Level 2: Intermediate
- [ ] Build complex single-page apps
- [ ] Master project scaffolding
- [ ] Handle dependencies and configuration
- [ ] Debug and fix AI-generated code

### Level 3: Advanced
- [ ] Architect full-stack applications
- [ ] Optimize AI-generated code
- [ ] Create reusable Vibe Coding workflows
- [ ] Teach others Vibe Coding techniques

## Memory Structure

Store learning in:
- `memory/knowledge/vibe-coding/basics.md` - Core concepts
- `memory/knowledge/vibe-coding/patterns.md` - Effective prompts
- `memory/knowledge/vibe-coding/examples.md` - Successful projects
- `memory/projects/[project-name]/` - Project documentation

## Auto-Learning Triggers

### On New Request
```yaml
if: request involves programming
then:
  - Use Vibe Coding approach first
  - Document the prompt pattern used
  - Save successful patterns for reuse
```

### On Error
```yaml
if: generated code has issues
then:
  - Analyze what went wrong
  - Learn from the fix
  - Update pattern library
```

### Weekly Review
```yaml
trigger: Sunday 10:00
task:
  - Review all Vibe Coding sessions
  - Identify most effective patterns
  - Update knowledge base
  - Plan next week's focus
```

## Tools Integration

### Preferred Models for Vibe Coding
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (current) - Strong code generation
- Claude Opus 4.6 - Complex problem solving
- GPT-4o - Alternative with good performance
- Gemini 2.0 Pro - Another strong option

### Key Skills to Use
- `code` - For implementation details
- `planning` - For complex projects
- `elite-longterm-memory` - To remember patterns
- `agent-team-orchestration` - For multi-agent tasks

## Success Metrics

Track progress:
- Number of projects completed with Vibe Coding
- Average prompts per project (goal: <10)
- Code quality rating
- Time to completion vs traditional coding

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Describe exactly what you want
2. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
3. **Verify**: Always test AI-generated code
4. **Document**: Save what works for reuse
5. **Learn**: Treat each session as a learning opportunity
